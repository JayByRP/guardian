# Discord Moderating Template Manager

A Discord bot that posts predefined templates via slash commands.


It's stuck thinking after posting
Posts the template twice, once, then ping, then again

If template 5, remove unverified role (if they have it) and add verified role (and separators, and other roles, in case carl fucked up) to users
If template 8, remove characterless role (if they have it) and add verified role (if they don't have it) to users
